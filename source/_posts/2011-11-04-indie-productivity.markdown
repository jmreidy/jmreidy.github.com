Being a contract web developer means working in a large number of enterprise
environments. While clients and projects vary dramatically, enterprise
environments almost always share certain characteristics in common: locked down
networks, limited use of open source libraries (and certainly no
contribution!), extreme caution regarding new technologies, and reliance on
libraries and tools which some might consider... deprecated. Most of these
characteristics are perfectly logical, given the complexity of enterprise
projects and the security required by legal considerations. Enterprise software
is frequently disregarded as sloppy, boring, uncreative, and poor -- and I've
certainly worked on these kinds of projects, and dealt with some
frustrating situations -- but classifying *all* software in this way is unfair.
That said, even the best of enterprise projects feel constraining compared to
independent work.

Recent developments have certainly improvemed the enterprise work
environment. The proliferation of iOS devices has not only brought Macs into
the traditionally Windows-only world of the enterprise; it's brought a new
focus on standards-based webapps, which has forced
a reconsideration of existing technology stacks. As enterprises have adopted
dynamic languages and agile approaches -- albeit slowly -- they've begun
upgrading their toolsets, as well. [Github's announcement of an enterprise plan](https://github.com/blog/978-introducing-github-enterprise) demonstrates that it's starting to feel a little bit more
human within the confines of corporate intranets.

But even as the enterprise has evolved, the improvements made for individual
developer productivity have exploded. The ease with which a single developer
can build and deploy a scalable, cross-device, and revenue generating app is
beyond remarkable. The maturing of tools, languages, development environments,
and deployment strategies has created a fantastically productive environment.
To name a few favorites:

* Macbooks - The new Macbook Airs, when fully tricked out, offer incredibly
powerful development workhorses weighing less than 3 pounds and costing
less than $2k

* [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) - A package manager for Mac OS, 
making that Macbook purchase perfect


* [Heroku](http://heroku.com) - Have an idea for a new project? Deploy it for
free. Want to scale it? Flip a switch

* [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) and [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) - Want
more control than Heroku offers? Fine, manage your own boxes with
a sane devops solution that you can take with you.

* Git and [Github](http://github.com) - Who could have ever imagined that
managing code could be so enjoyable? 

* zsh and [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - Tab completion, customizable plugins, persistent Git HUD

* The incredible profusion of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks - [Scala](http://scala-lang.org),
[Clojure](http://clojure.org),
[node.js](http://nodejs.org), the [Play framework](http://www.playframework.org/), NoSql solutions,
nginx, to say nothing of the maturing of Ruby (especially Rails) and Python - all of
these technologies make it easier than ever to work in one's preferred
style without sacrificing power or performance. The communities around each
of these technologies, empowered by twitter, StackExchange, and Github,
ease learning curves and offer helpful answers to any questions. 

* The Apple App store, [Square](https://squareup.com/), [Stripe](http://stripe.com), [Recurly](http://recurly.com/),
and [Samurai](https://samurai.feefighters.com/) enable developers to make money on their ideas and apps
with far less effort than in the past.

Is there *any other industry* in which an individual has such a *dramatic*
advantage in tools, cost, and agility over large organizations? 

It's an exciting time for indie developers. And the future keeps looking better.
