I've never been a fan of links posts - they always feel like "clips 
episodes" from sitcoms to me - but I've realized that they can be pretty helpful, if
they're well curated. I'm going to be experimenting with the "well curated" sort
of links posts. Please feel free to yell at me on twitter 
if these get boring.

* A scaffold for your node - [scaffoldit](https://github.com/spiceapps/scaffoldit)
is a customizable scaffold generator for your nodejs projects. I don't think that there's
*that* much boilerplate for express based apps, but this library is still pretty helpful for
getting my tests and basic app configured quickly.

* Basic metaprogramming in Ruby - If you're new to Ruby and are confused by some of 
the metaprogramming enabled by methods like `repond_to?` and `method_missing`, check 
out [this helpful post](http://intridea.com/posts/dry-magic-methods) from the Intridea
blog.

* Build first, talk later - Spencer Fry, founder of Carbonmade, offers some fine advice
to [show don't tell](http://spencerfry.com/show-dont-tell) - a prototype is worth 
ten thousand words. I particularly like his observation that "The best thinking
about your product will come from actually building it."

* Productivity geekery - [Brett Terpstra reviews](http://brettterpstra.com/app-review-dropzone/) 
the mother-of-all-menubar-apps, Dropzone. I haven't bought it yet myself, but I'm pretty close to pulling the trigger.

* Writing your readme - Awhile back, nodejitsu offered 
[some solid advice](http://blog.nodejitsu.com/package-dependencies-done-right) 
on setting up your node project's `package.json` file. 
Now they're back with some more great advice, but this time it's more universal: 
[how to write a *helpful* readme for your next open source project](http://blog.nodejitsu.com/how-to-write-a-readme).

* After reading Umair Haque's excellent [New Capitalist Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/New-Capitalist-Manifesto-Building-Disruptively/dp/1422158586), I've been thinking a great deal about the values
of sustainability in business and how value cycles drastically improve upon value chains. 
I was excited to see [Fred Wilson explore the same issues on his blog](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/11/sustainability.html): 
{% blockquote %}
sustainability is all about figuring out how to be in business forever. It is about business models that are win/win and lead to happy long term customer and supplier relationships. It is about avoiding the temptation to overeach. It is about avoiding the temptation to mazimize near term profits at the expense of long term health. It is about adapting the business to changing market dynamics. It is about building a team and a culture that can survive the loss of the leader and keep going. And it is about many more things like this.
