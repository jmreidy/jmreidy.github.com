If you only know me through this blog, and have spent any amount of
time playing Oregon Trail in your youth, you may have grown a bit
concerned. It's been four months since
[my last post](http://rzrsharp.net/2012/02/17/goodbye-brooklyn-hello-portland.html), in which I wrote
about my upcoming move to Portland, OR; since then, there's been total
silence here. I'm happy to report that, over the course of my
cross-country move, I didn't contract dysentery,
drown in a reckless attempt at fording a river, or suffer a terrible
firearms accident while hunting squirrels. In fact, I had better luck
with the move than I possibly could have imagined. Our drive to
Minneapolis avoided any nasty weather; our flight from Minneapolis to
Portland proceeded without incident; our new house was solidly intact and
without any animal squatters; and our movers arrived with all of our
belongings at the exactly scheduled time (to the minute!) with nothing
broken or lost.

Portland has lived up to, and perhaps exceeded, our expectations.
Being able to bike around a city without a constant fear of death and
dismemberment has been quite a refreshing change. Living in a house
has allowed us to actually grow a legitimate garden instead of
stuffing a few pots in a fire escape. We couldn't be happier with the
food scene here; the amount of craft beer in
Portland is downright intimidating. And it's been extraordinarily
exciting to meet so many other new Portlanders who've moved here for
similar reasons. Needless to say, if you're a developer who's thinking
about Portland as a place to call home, feel free to drop me a line,
or introduce yourself if you'll be coming to
[node conf](http://nodeconf.com) in July.

I've finally had to declare blog bankruptcy here, in order to just
wipe the list of well-intentioned-blog-topics clear and get started
writing again. Two topics will survive the culling. First, the move to
Portland presented an opportunity for a spring cleaning of my
development environment. I'll be writing about how I organized my
dotfiles, and explaining why tmux is not just a cargo culting fad, but
a ridiculously awesome tool for maximizing your terminal productivity.

The other surviving topic surrounds Backbone.js. Since moving to
Portland, I've continued working with Bloomberg Sports in New York on
their application for MLB team analytics. (Think a modern web app
version of Moneyball spreadsheets.) Working on such a large app has
presented me with some difficult lessons on how to best use Backbone,
especially for interacting with a polyglot backend, which I think
would prove useful to any other web devs working on larger Backbone
applications.

So now, back to work so I can actually get these posts written in the
next week!
