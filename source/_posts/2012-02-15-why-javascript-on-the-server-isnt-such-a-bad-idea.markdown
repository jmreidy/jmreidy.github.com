Preaching the gospel of Node can be a tough job: how do you express your
excitement for the technology without coming across as a fanboy? And how do you
deal with people that view it as a cancer? I had to answer these questions when
crafting a presentation last week introducting Node.js as part of
a developer tech talk. Given the radically divergent opinions that Node has
elicited, I wanted to address the FUD head on.  I tried to focus on the gut
reaction most people tend to have towards Node ("WHO would want to code their
server in JS?!"), and I think the talk went fairly well. I'm embedding the
slides here if anyone would like to take a look. Speakerdeck is a fantastic
resource and I was happy to finally put it to use as a producer, instead of
just a reader.
