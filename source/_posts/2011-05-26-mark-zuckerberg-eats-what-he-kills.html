<blockquote> I don't have an issue with anything people choose to eat, but I do think they should take responsibility and be thankful for what they eat rather than trying to ignore where it came from.<p><cite>--Mark Zuckerberg, on his new food philosophy.</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting article from <a href="http://postcards.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2011/05/26/mark-zuckerbergs-new-challenge-eating-only-what-he-kills/">Fortune</a> (of all places) on Mark Zuckerberg's approach to eating, which he adopted as a sort of New Year's resolution. Zuckerberg is apparently only eating meat from animals he has slaughtered himself. (How this sort of thing registers as financial news, I have no idea.</p>
<p>According to the article, Mark adopts a challenge for himself every year, in order to improve himself and better his understanding of the world, and this year's challenge was to come to terms with the food he eats. "[M]y personal challenge is around being thankful for the food I have to eat. I think many people forget that a living being has to die for you to eat meat, so my goal revolves around not letting myself forget that and being thankful for what I have," Zuckerberg wrote to Fortune.</p>
<p>Software engineers have a (partially undeserved) reputation of being ignorant pigs when it comes to food - with snack rooms at many offices stuffed with Funyuns and Twinkies - so it's great to see one of the world's most prominent engineers (and a celebrity in his own right) so consciously investigate the source of his food.</p>
