My name is Justin Reidy. I build web apps. I live in Portland, OR.

The majority of my work is written in JavaScript; you can find my active
projects [on Github](https://github.com/jmreidy). If you're building a project
with Node.JS, or have a complex client-side application in need of some love,
please feel free [to get in touch](mailto:jmreidy@rzrsharp.net).

When I'm not coding, I'm probably running. I may also be shopping at the farmers'
market, at home cooking something delicious, futzing around my Chemex, enjoying the bounty
of Orgeon's many vineyards and brewers, or adventuring with [my wife Meaghin](https://thesesaltyoats.com).
